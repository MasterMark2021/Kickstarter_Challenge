# Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns

## Overview of Project
This project is aim at providing explanation or description of the data generated with respect to Louiseâ€™s fundraising goal in a short amount of time. Louise wants to know how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals. 

## Analysis and Challenges
The Kickstarter campaign  has more than 4,000 rows of data, which present some tough decision for analysis. There are 9 distinct Parent category and  41 unique Subcategory.
Splitting the original Category and Subcategory of the data provided us with better view to analyse the data better otherwise analysis would have been more challenging. 
There are 4 expected outcome for this campaign data however only 3 outcomes were of most interest to us and Louise, so we have to streamline analysis of the data  to 3 unique outcomes.
