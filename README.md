# Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns

## Overview of Project
This project is aim at providing explanation or description of the data generated with respect to Louiseâ€™s fundraising goal in a short amount of time. Louise wants to know how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals. 

## Analysis and Challenges
The Kickstarter campaign  has more than 4,000 rows of data, which present some tough decision for analysis. There are 9 distinct Parent category and  41 unique Subcategory.
Splitting the original Category and Subcategory of the data provided us with better view to analyse the data better otherwise analysis would have been more challenging. 
There are 4 expected outcome for this campaign data however only 3 outcomes were of most interest to us and Louise, so we have to streamline analysis of the data  to 3 unique outcomes. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
Analysis of outcomes based on lauch date shows that outcomes between April - August. There are more successful outcomes in April, May, June, July and August than for failed and canceled outcomes. There are less canceled outcomes within this period meaning more successful, followed by failed. There are less outcomes during the start of the campaigns, then we recorded an increase in campaign outcomes as we progress and then a decrease in campaign outcome from September through to Dec.  Refer to the visualization for this data using  Theater as a sample case study.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
From the data and visualization of the outcomes based on goals, the number of successful outcome based on the goals ranges are higher between goals less than 1,000 and goals less than or equal to 10,000. The % of successful outcomes is higher than failed and canceled outcomes.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
   1. There are more successful outcomes in April, May, June, July and August than for failed and canceled outcomes
   2. There are less outcomes during the start (Jan- March) of the campaigns, then we recorded an increase in campaign outcomes as we progress (April - August) and then a             decrease    in campaign outcome from September through to Dec. 

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
   1. The number of successful outcome based on the goals ranges are higher between goals less than 1,000 and goals less than or equal to 10,000.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
